	<h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
	<h2>Author: Shuen</h2>

    <p>
        A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that 
        many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into 
        their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that 
        there was a significant increase in the percent of households 
        taking in a new dog, fish or bird. Their research also indicated 
        that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such 
        as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Companionship</li>
        <li>Better Mental Health</li>
        <li>Joy and Happiness</li>
    </ul>

            Figure 1. Percent of popular pets owned by Australians in 2019.

    </figure>

    <p>
        With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy 
        makers to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners 
        when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are 
        well as accepting animals in public places and transport.
